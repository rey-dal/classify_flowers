# Image Classifier Project

This project implements a deep learning model to classify images using PyTorch. It's part of the AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. The project uses transfer learning with pre-trained neural networks to classify 102 different species of flowers.

## What is Transfer Learning?
Transfer learning is an AI technique where we take a neural network that's already been trained on millions of images (in this case, trained on ImageNet) and adapt it for our specific flower classification task. Instead of starting from scratch, we:
1. Take a pre-trained network that already knows how to recognize general image features
2. Keep the network's learned features but replace its final classification layer
3. Train only the new classification layer to recognize our specific flower types

This approach is much more efficient than training a network from scratch because:
- We leverage knowledge already learned from millions of images
- We need much less training data
- Training time is significantly reduced
- The model often performs better than training from scratch

## Project Implementation
The project uses PyTorch's torchvision library and includes:

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Image resizing to 224x224 pixels
   - Data augmentation (random rotation, flipping, etc.)
   - Normalization using ImageNet statistics

2. Model Architecture:
   - Pre-trained network as feature extractor
   - Custom classifier layer for 102 flower categories
   - Uses PyTorch's neural network modules (torch.nn)

3. Training Process:
   - Data is divided into training, validation, and test sets for training and evaluation.
   - Uses cross-entropy loss and optimization
   - Implements early stopping for better generalization
